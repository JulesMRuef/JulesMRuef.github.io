# Juliana's Fabulous Earth Data Science Portfolio

"I was looking upon the counterpart of the great river systems of Arctic Asia and America...a plastic, moving, semi-solid mass...ploughing its way with irresistable march through the crust of an investing sea" 

*Elisha Kent Kane, on the Humbold Glacier, Greenland (1854)*


## Academic Interests

The global physical environment is a vast and complex machine composed of numerous interconnected systems capable of dramatic change over brief intervals of time. A solid understanding of the character and dynamics of this machine can explain a diversity of engaging geographical phenomena, from the aesthetically stunning views on a high Sierra Nevada mountain summit to the devastating loss of life and property resulting from landslides and floods. I am interested in designing, improving, evaluating, and enjoying such explanations.

Mechanism by which this is achieved:

(1) to build a rigorous physically-based understanding of environmental processes and system dynamics

(2) to reconstruct the remarkable “natural experiments” of Earth’s environmental history 

# Current Projects

## Rock Glaciers
> ### What are they? 
Rock glaciers consist of moving ice that is covered in rocks and debris that shield them from melting
> ### Why do we care?

Ø Most	frequented cryospheric objects in	mid-latitude	mountain	ranges		

Ø Important	roles	in	mountain hydrology

Ø Important	roles	in	the	evolution	of	mountain slopes	over	the	short	and	long term

Ø Past climate indicator

Ø Primary	markers	of	mountain	permafrost	evolution

Ø Represent	a	real	natural risk …
